After returning from a trip to Bali in1994,
 something happened that would forever change my life.
  For one week, each thought of every moment became related to those things occurring in physical reality, 
  as if the very thought was creating it! 
  Psychologist Carl Jung defined such experiences as synchronicity,
 or meaningful coincidences.
 Many of the events involved music, 
 whose lyrics perfectly reflected what was happening at the moment.
  The result was both electrifying and unsettling.
  What level of intelligence could operate in this way, 
  and what was it leading toward?
